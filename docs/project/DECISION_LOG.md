# Decision Log

This is an append-only log of accepted durable product and architecture
decisions. Do not silently rewrite past decisions. If a decision changes,
append a new entry and mark the earlier entry superseded.

## D-001 — PostgreSQL authority

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** PostgreSQL is authoritative after operational cutover. SQLite is
frozen rollback/archive only.

**Reason:** The reviewed cutover, PostgreSQL-backed staging verification, and
runtime smoke established PostgreSQL as the deployed system of record.

**Consequences:** Current operations and architecture must not describe SQLite
as authoritative. SQLite artifacts remain preserved for rollback/archive and
historical tooling.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** Supersedes the pre-cutover SQLite-authoritative
state. Not superseded.

## D-002 — No hidden persistence synchronization

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** No dual-write, reverse sync, silent SQLite fallback, startup
auto-import, or startup auto-Alembic.

**Reason:** Hidden synchronization and mutation paths increase corruption,
rollback ambiguity, and production risk.

**Consequences:** Runtime fails closed, migrations are explicit, and rollback
boundaries remain operator-controlled.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-003 — Shared features are multilingual

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** All shared learner features are multilingual by default; current
required languages are EN and ZH.

**Reason:** BECOMING is one product, not independent English and Chinese forks.

**Consequences:** Shared contracts are language-neutral. Adapters exist only
for real linguistic differences, and language-scoped data remains isolated.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-004 — First public product composition

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** The first public learning product is Writing plus Speaking, both
complete for EN and ZH.

**Reason:** The release must deliver a coherent productive-language loop rather
than prematurely publishing a partial skill set.

**Consequences:** Writing COMPLETE, Speaking COMPLETE, EN PASS, and ZH PASS are
all mandatory before public promotion.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-005 — Reading and Listening release separately

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Reading releases separately after the first public product;
Listening releases later still.

**Reason:** Their completion and acceptance gates are distinct from the first
Writing + Speaking product.

**Consequences:** Existing internal Reading work does not imply a public claim.
Listening remains hidden future work.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-006 — AI Control Plane scope

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** The AI Capability Control Plane manages AI workloads only.

**Reason:** Provider configuration, capability routing, and AI diagnostics form
a bounded infrastructure concern.

**Consequences:** It does not become a registry for identity, Social, or
deterministic product domains unrelated to AI infrastructure.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-007 — Social is not an AI domain

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Social is not an AI capability or AI-owned domain. Its future
concept includes Rooms, Friends, Messaging, Presence, Reactions, Blocking, and
Moderation.

**Reason:** Social interaction must remain available when AI is unavailable.
AI may assist Social but cannot own its continuity.

**Consequences:** Future Social contracts and storage stay outside the AI
Control Plane. Documentation does not imply Social is currently implemented.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-008 — Modular monolith

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** The architecture remains a modular monolith for now, not
microservices.

**Reason:** Current scale and team coordination benefit from explicit module and
repository boundaries without distributed-system overhead.

**Consequences:** Domain boundaries are conceptual and enforce ownership inside
one deployable application.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-009 — Initial realtime Social architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** When Social is implemented, initial realtime architecture should
prefer FastAPI WebSocket plus PostgreSQL. Redis is deferred until scale requires
it.

**Reason:** This preserves operational simplicity while leaving a clear scaling
path.

**Consequences:** Do not introduce Redis preemptively or treat this decision as
authorization to implement Social now.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-010 — No silent paid-provider failover

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** No provider-to-provider silent paid failover.

**Reason:** Cost, privacy, behavior, and operator intent must remain explicit.

**Consequences:** Provider failures are visible and typed; changing providers is
an explicit configuration or future reviewed policy decision.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-011 — Static and live AI validation are separate

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Static AI configuration validation is separate from live
provider/model validation.

**Reason:** Valid configuration must be persistable while a provider is offline,
while live tests need precise credentials, catalog, transport, and response
diagnostics.

**Consequences:** Configuration mutation performs no provider network call;
explicit live-test APIs own runtime validation.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-012 — Atomic learner runtime activation

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Learner capability routing activation must be atomic; mixed
partial activation is prohibited.

**Reason:** Partial workload migration would create inconsistent behavior and an
unclear rollback boundary.

**Consequences:** Until the reviewed activation gate passes,
`generate_structured()` remains wholly on legacy `active_selection()`.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-013 — Human coordination and repository context

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** The human remains the coordinator between agents; verified Git
state and repository governance documents are persistent project context.

**Reason:** Chat histories are incomplete and transient across implementation,
review, and domain agents.

**Consequences:** Agents follow the canonical read order, update handoffs and
state responsibly, and stop on material contradictions or human gates.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

## D-014 — Shared Media Learning content

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** An imported media source is processed once into one reusable,
provider-neutral Media Learning Object. Its source-language transcript,
timestamped segments, and support-language translations are shared learning
content consumed by both Listening and Speaking Shadowing and reusable by
Vocabulary / Library and Grammar.

**Reason:** Independent media representations for Listening and Shadowing would
duplicate acquisition and processing, allow transcript identity to drift, and
disconnect vocabulary and grammar evidence from the source learners actually
used.

**Consequences:** Learner progress is not part of shared media content. Listening
progress, Shadowing attempts, saved vocabulary, learned segments, and exercise
outcomes remain scoped by user and learning language. M1 may deliver a
non-public Listening MVP before R11; R11 remains the Listening completion and
public-release-readiness gate. R9 remains advanced Shadowing completion rather
than the first authorization for media learning. This decision does not make
Listening or Speaking public and does not close R2.

**Supersedes / Superseded by:** None.

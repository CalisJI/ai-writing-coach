"""The provider poll is claimed atomically, so repeated polling cannot spend twice.

The defect these lock down: the registry held a lock, but `poll()` fetched the
mutable record and then mutated it *outside* that lock, and called the provider
without claiming the right to do so. Two concurrent `/import/status` requests for
one job could therefore both call Supadata - duplicating paid quota - and race
each other's state writes.

Supadata charges per request, so "one provider call in flight per job" is a cost
contract, not only a correctness one. A browser polling once a second for a
90-second import must cost one job, not ninety.
